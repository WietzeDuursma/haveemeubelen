Allows your users to translate your blog into many different languages. The button is added to the top of every post.

== Description ==

A free **translation** button provided by [Translation Cloud](http://translation-cloud.com/ "free translation") allowing visitors to **translate** 
your website into over 35 languages. Translate This is powered by Bing and combines all its translation functionality into one 
small, easy to use button. Once installed, the button will appear at the top of every post on the main page, as well as at the top 
of the individual posts.

Translate This supports over 35 languages.

== Installation ==

1. Upload translate-this-blog-translator folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. If your website is not in English, go to the settings page and select the language from the dropdown menu.
1. If selecting a language has no effect, you may want to check the "use valid jQuery" checkbox. (Caution: may cause conflicts with other plugins or themes.)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= When will you be adding support for new languages? =

Since the button only uses Microsoft Translator, we have no control of when new languages will be available. Once Microsoft 
does add a new language, we try to add support for that language as quickly as possible.

= Bing added a new language, and it's not available through Translate This. Why is that? =

When Bing adds a new language it is not automatically available through Translate This. This is because we must make internal changes 
to our program telling it the language is available and how to handle it. Also, we need to add a flag image for that language. We make every 
effort to keep the translator's available language list as up to date as possible.
