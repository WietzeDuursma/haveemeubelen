This plugin allows you to put your site into maintenance mode, by allowing only users with specified IP addresses to view the site.

== Description ==

Easily put your site into maintenance mode with this plugin so that you can perform updates. The plugin works by taking a selection of IP addresses and comparing them to the visitor's IP address.

Users whose IP addresses match those specified in the settings page can view the site normally. Users who do not have IP access are directed either you a Wordpress page (which you pick), or to any external url.

It's extremely simple to use: 

* activate the plugin
* go to the "Maintenance Mode" settings
* check the "Enable Box"
* enter the IP addresses that should have access
* choose whether to redirect non-authorized users to a page or url
* choose the page or enter the url

Once your site is ready to be made available again, simple uncheck the "Enable" box.
